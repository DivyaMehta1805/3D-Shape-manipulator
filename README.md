# 3D Shape Creator and Editor

## Overview
Link to the project in action: 

The 3D Shape Creator and Editor is an interactive tool built with Babylon.js that enables users to create and edit 3D shapes. Users can draw 2D shapes on a ground plane, extrude them into 3D objects, move these objects in the scene, and modify individual vertices. The tool is designed with an intuitive GUI to streamline the user experience.

## Features
